<p><I> As a student the most unforgettable moment I will forever cherish in my heart and mind was our cheers and yells, it was full of energy,fun,and love. the sports fest made us to unite and build a good relationship to others by giving ideas, sharing fum& laughhter and helping one another by participating in the said cheers and yells. the best experience was to walk around the oval & have fun beneath the sun, which keeps us  more energetic& lively, it boost our creativity& be able to decide the best props for us to use.As a student leader,ot was quite hectic and difficult to organize my calssmates and also the other grade level to position themselves according to their grade level. I may not participated  in opthers sports, but I am  also be able to make banner  for our secftion, and for supporting the t6eachers who playes  the volleyball which is a huge ball,and that moment I will forever keep in my heart. Those moments, our laughter, our cheers, and ouir participation by winning in  volleyball & cheers and yells was the best experience I will always remember. We may noty be abvle to get the first place, but the fun and the laughter was the best prize for me</I><P>
